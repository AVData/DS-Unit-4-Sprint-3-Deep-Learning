# Unit 4 Sprint 3: Major Neural Network Architectures

This week we will review several popular feed-forward neural network architectures that are common in commercial applications. 
--- 
* Module 1: RNNs & LSTMs
  - Objectives: 
      1. Describe recurrent neural network architecture
          - Neural network architecture description provided
      2. Use an LSTM to generate text based on some input
          - Need to go back and review LSTM model for text generation
* Module 2: CNNs
  - Objectives: 
      1. Describe convolutions and convolutions within neural networks
          - Need to read through more conv literature 
      2. Apply pre-trained CNNs to object detection problems
          - CNNs applied to object detection poroblems, but what more can we do with this?
* Module 3: Autoencoders
  - Objectives:
      1. Describe the componenets of an autoencoder
          - need to complete all of these
      2. Train an autoencoder
      3. Apply an autoencoder to a basic information retreval problem
* Module 4: Artificial General Intelligence & the Future
  - Objectives: 
      1. Describe the history of artificial intelligence research
      2. Know the important research achievements in AI
      3. Delineate the ethnical challenges faces AI
